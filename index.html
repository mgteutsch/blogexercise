			<p style="padding-left: 50px">So this is some text to go with this article. Really, just filler... I want to get a good idea of the default style that goes with some of these tags. I'm going to end this paragraph tag and start another one below.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 50px">So here's the new p tag. We should see an automatic space above. Hopefully it worked. Ok, now blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and a little bit more right here. Let's wrap this article up with a footer with the author and pub date.</p>

		<h2>Art 2 Cool: Article 2</h2>

			<p style="padding-left: 50px">These some shitty puns worthy of being sentenced to hell.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 50px">Like, you get to the gates, and Peter's there like "Oh, ok, so you're the murderer, right?" I have this look of confusion like, nope, that's some other guy. "Ah, I see," he says, "It's Teutsch with an <i><b>"eu"</b></i> -- my bad." He keeps flipping through the great book of the dead, and then a look of concern grew on his face. "Oh, I see. Yes, <i>this</i> lines up. You're 'Teutsch' with the 'eu'... and the shitty puns. Well, looks like you're about to be in one hell of a situation."</p>
